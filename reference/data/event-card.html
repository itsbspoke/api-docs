    <h3>Available via</h3>
    <p>Using the <a href="../api/live-events.html#event-card">Event participation</a> API endpoint.</p>
    <h3>References</h3>
    <p><a href="./user.html#summary">User summary</a> and <a href="./live-event.html">Live event summary</a> forms are contained within this model.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Are clients better served by partitioning server-side into the three types (pending,scored,unscorable), or in the same collection?</p>
    <p>Should statistics and presence be nested?  What's the meaning of three different presence status indicators?</p>
    <p>Do we have all the statistics we need?  This should be 'last call' for statistics, new ones will need to wait for 1.0.1 or similar.</p>
