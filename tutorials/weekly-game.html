    <h2>Introduction  <small>about the weekly game</small></h2>
  </div>

    <div class="span8">
      <p>At the time of the release of the 1.0 API, our most popular product has been our live game 
      experience, where companion content is provided for a live television broadcast.  This places limits on 
      when you can experience OtherScreen content to only a few hours each week.  The weekly game is intended 
      to allow familiar gameplay to our users at any time during the week.</p>
      <p>While we will launch with only a single weekly game, we intend to add the ability to have users
      ask questions in the future, as well as potentially release focused weekly games for (say) 20 weeks.</p>
      <p>Single questions will be released throughout the week (5 per day).  At any time, a player may request the status
      of their weekly game, seeing how many questions they can answer.</p>
      <p>When they choose to play during a week, push notifications will be sent to their device, notifying
      them that new questions are available.  A push notification will be sent each time a question is made available.</p>
      <p>When playing the weekly game, a player will be presented a multiple choice question.  After they 
      are presented with the question, a timer will begin to count down from 20 seconds, this should be represented with a decrementing progress bar preferably located at the bottom of the view.  Should the timer reach 0, 
      the player will not have an opportunity to answer the question at all.  If the player answers correctly before
     time expires, they will be awarded points based on how much time is left. If a player answers 
      incorrectly, they'll be shown the correct answer and will receive no points.</p>
      <p>If there are more questions to answer after the first in the session, the player may continue via a 'next' button.
      If there are no more, a "done" button should allow the player to see the leaderboard state.</p>
      <p>Players may end their session with a quit button, or the home button at any time.</p>
      <p>Each week will have a fixed number of possible questions, right now the number we are using is 35 based on 5 questions per day.</p>
      <p>There is a leaderboard for the weekly game with a maximum of 10 entries.  Leaderboard data will 
      include player name, progress (i.e. 17/35 attempted/total) and their total score. The
      leaderboard data may also include a separate indication of a player's ranking, if they are not in the top 10.</p>

      <p>This request should be issued both when a user starts a play session, and when a

      <p>Readers of this document are likely familiar with our previous method of submitting answers to questions.
      There are two primary differences; we'll deal with the first here. Questions in the weekly game are timed.  
      If they aren't answered in time, they can't be answered at all.  Clients are responsible for indicating 
      the questions are expired, when they have the ability to do so.  The primary examples of this will be
      when the user hits a quit or close button while the question is in front of them, or if they simply
      lose track of time and let the timer expire.</p>
      <p>Further, clients are responsible for determining how long a question took to answer, and the
      server will accept their interpretation.  The server will not allow questions to take more than
      1 minute to answer, and the client side restriction is intended to be 20 seconds on the countdown timer.
      Other than that, the client is responsible for keeping track of how long the user had the question
      active, and to say how many points to give them, should their answer be correct.  At this writing, it is
      unclear what the total number of possible points are available per question. For the time being operate 
      under the assumption that it is 1 point per second, 20 possible points per question.</p>

      <p>When a user lets time run out on a question or hits quit while a question is in front
      of them, the client is expected to let the server know that the user will not answer
      the question.</p>
      <p>There is a time limit on the server-side that will prevent an answer from being
      registered more than 1 minute later from when the client first requested the question.
      When the client has specific knowledge, however, that the user cannot answer the question
      in time, please register that knowledge with the service.</p>

      at a single endpoint, we will determine what form our push notifications
      must take in order to allow the client device to engage with the weekly
      gameplay endpoint without further interaction on the part of the user.</p>
