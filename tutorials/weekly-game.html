      <p>At the time of the release of the 1.0 API, our most popular product has been our live game experience, where companion content is provided for a live television broadcast.  This places limits on when you can experience OtherScreen content to only a few hours each week.  The weekly game is intended to allow familiar gameplay to our users at any time during the week.</p>
      <p>Single questions will be released throughout the week.  At any time, a player may request the status of their weekly game, seeing how many questions they can answer.</p>
      <p>When they choose to play during a week, push notifications will be sent to their device, notifying them that new questions are available.  This notification will be sent once until they answer more questions.</p>
      <p>When playing the weekly game, a player will be presented a multiple choice question.  After they are presented with the question, a timer will begin to count down from 20 seconds.  Should the timer reach 0, the player will not have an opportunity to answer the question at all.  If the player answers correctly, with time remaining on the clock, they will be awarded points based on how much time is left. If a player answers incorrectly, they'll be shown the correct answer and will receive no points.</p>
      <p>If there are more questions to answer after the first in the session, the player may continue via a 'next' button.</p>
      <p>Players may end their session with a quit button, or the home button at any time.</p>
      <p>There is a leaderboard for the weekly game with a maximum of 10 entries.  Leaderboard data will include player name, progress (i.e. 3 correct, 4 incorrect, 6 not attempted) and their total score. The leaderboard data may also include a seperate indication of a player's ranking, if they are not in the top 10.</p>
