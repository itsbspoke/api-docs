      <p>OtherScreen intends to build a social TV platform with an API easily understood and utilized from every language and environment.</p>
      <p>We are starting with web and iOS client implementations, but we'll be using examples from curl throughout this documentation.</p>
      <p>The following tips are to help get you started, and we'll explain them one by one.</p>

        <h3>Quick Start</h3>
        <p>All requests should be HTTPS and made to <b>https://app.otherscreen.com/</b></p>
        <p>All requests must include an accept header <b>application/vnd.otherscreen.com; version=1</b></p>
        <p>All requests must include a unique user-agent header that indicates client platform, and version number for the client implementation.</p>
        <p>An example User-Agent header would be <b>OtherScreen iOS 1.3.1</b></p>
        <p>To authenticate a user, acquire an authorization token and set the <b>HTTP_X_OTHERSCREEN_AUTH_TOKEN</b> header to that token value.</p>

<!-- API Reference
================================================== -->
<section id="https">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h2>HTTPS  <small>Secure transmission by default</small></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
      <p>Since the API allows account sign-in and account creation with a password, we choose to secure our entire transmission with clients.</p>
      <p>Even a single request made over HTTP can allow a man-in-the-middle to hijack session information and gain access to a user profile.</p>
      <p>While requests made via HTTP are not yet rejected, they may be without elevating the API version number.  We will not consider this a breaking change.</p>

      <p>There are two choices for where to access our API.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Production</dt>
        <dd>https://app.otherscreen.com/</dd>
        <dt>Staging</dt>

      <p>You should use staging during the development of the app whenever possible.  Please open a line of communication to our technical staff using <a href="https://otherscreen.zendesk.com/home">our Help Desk</a> if you are interested in gaining access and training to our staging site.</p>

    <h2>API Versioning  <small>our API guarantees</small></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
      <p>Our 1.0 API indicates a commitment by our technical team to never compromise the behavior of your client implementation for the lifetime of that API version.  At this time, we have no plans to ever retire an API.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of this decision, you must indicate which version of the API that you intend to use with an accept header.  If, for any reason, our engineers introduce new or amend existing data forms, we pledge to increment the API version required in this accept header to receive the new data form.</p>
      <p>In other words, when you use an accept header that indicates you want version 1.0 of the API, we'll never introduce a change in the form of the result you get back.</p>
      <p>At this time, there are no other choices for API version, so make your Accept header <b>application/vnd.otherscreen.com; version=1</b></p>

    <h2>Client Identification  <small>we're not ready for API tokens</small></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span8">
      <p>Enterprise level API's such as Twitter can require an API token for use.  This allows Twitter to defend itself against malicious or incidental bad behaviors by clients.  Our API does not yet meet that level of need, but we intend to.</p>
      <p>What is vital for us to understand, however, is for us to understand which clients are currently being used by our players-- as well as which are under development and which features are being used by which implementation.</p>
      <p>To that end, you are asked to self-select a unique string that describes the client you are building.  Platform, version, and author may all be related details.  At this time, the only prohibited choice is <b>com.otherscreen.OtherScreen/5</b> which has been taken.</p>

    <div class="span8">
      <p>Much of the OtherScreen API requires a specific user to be signed in to return proper responses.  There are some <a href="../reference/api/authentication.html">choices regarding authentication</a>, all of which result in receiving an authentication token that uniquely identifieds a user.</p>
      <p>Use that authentication token in an OtherScreen-unique request header <b>HTTP_X_OTHERSCREEN_AUTH_TOKEN</b> which has been taken.</p>
