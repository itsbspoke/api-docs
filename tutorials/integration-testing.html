      <p>After reviewing the basics of how to make an API request to OtherScreen in the
      <a href="./getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> tutorial, you'll want to walk
      through making some requests to real endpoints to make sure you get how they work.</p>
      <p>Rather than having you junk up your own account, or request permissions that you
      may not need otherwise, we're providing some defined resources on our staging environment
      that have desirable properties for you to get around to all the places that you'll need
      to arrive at an implementation of an OtherScreen client.</p>
      <p>If you've ever played Portal, these names and references may be familiar to you.
      We're going to explore interacting with OtherScreen world from the context of a specific
      small set of users.</p>

      See the <a href="./preroll.html">Preroll</a> tutorial for more information.</p>
      <p>The live event will have a couple of chat messages in it, and a small leaderboard.  It should be a good starting place

      <p>For a variety of reasons, our group implementation never took off the way we'd imagined.  We currently
      have groups as a part of the web client only for administrators, so no group implementation work is currently
      needed on the part of any client.</p>
      <p>That said, if you'd like to implement groups, the Chell user has been invited to two different groups,
      (one from Cube, and one from Cave).
      In turn, she can create and invite Cube and Cave to groups as needed.</p>
