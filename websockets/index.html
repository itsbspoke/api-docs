<section id="subscriptions">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>Channel subscriptions <small>subscribing to the right channels</small></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span12">
      <h3>How to subscribe</h3>
      <p>Use the techniques below to create a channel name.  Use the channel name in the above call to subscribe to the channel.  The response you get back represents Step 6 in the <a href="http://pusher.com/docs/authenticating_users#authentication_process">Pusher documentation</a>.  Using the information that you get from auth, you'll have the ability to complete your channel subscription.</p>
      <h3>Channel naming preamble and postlude</h3>
      <p>All channel name schemes below begin and end with the same preamble and postlude and will not vary throughout your implementation.</p>
      <p>The preamble is formed by concatenating "presence-" with the environment your implementation targets.  Unless you are instructed otherwise by OtherScreen staff, that value will be "production".  So all channel names below will begin with "presence-production-".</p>
      <p>The postlude indicates which version of the API you are using.  At this time, that's "v1", so all channel names will end with "-v1" </p>
      <h3>Receiving events</h3>
      <p>After successfully subscribing to the channels described in this section, you will want to bind them to various event types from the bottom sections.  We'll enumerate them within the sections they may appear.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Live Event Channel</h3>
      <p><span class="label label-info">Related</span> 
        You should only subscribe to a single event channel at a time, after you 
        <a href="../reference/live_events/index.html#check-in">check into a live event</a> successfully.
        <span class="label label-info">Related</span> 
        If you find the live event has mandatory preroll, you may not wish to subscribe to the WebSocket channel immediately.
        See the <a href="../tutorials/preroll.html">Completing Preroll</a> tutorial for more information.
      </p>
      <h3>Channel name</h3>
      <pre>live-event-#{eventID}</pre>
      <p>So after including the preamble and postlude, an example would be:</p>
      <pre>presence-production-live-event-421-v1</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>User Channel</h3>
      <p><span class="label label-info">Related</span> 
        You will need both the authentication token and your user ID from your <a href="../reference/authentication/index.html">Authentication API</a> 
        of choice will supply a needed value to complete this subscription 
      </p>
      <h3>Channel name</h3>
      <pre>user-#{userID}</pre>
      <p>So after including the preamble and postlude, an example would be:</p>
      <pre>presence-production-user-7001-v1</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Group Channels</h3>
      <p></p>
      <p><span class="label label-info">Related</span> 
        You should complete an authentication request once for each group returned by the <a href="../reference/groups/index.html#listing">Group Listing API</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Channel name</h3>
      <p>The appropriate channel name has three components:</p>
      <p>The elements are combined in this scheme:</p>
      <pre>group-#{groupID}</pre>
      <p>So after including the preamble and postlude, an example would be:</p>
      <pre>presence-production-group-72-v1</pre>

    <div class="span4">
      <h3>Mobile connections need special care.</h3>
      <p>Please be aware that mobile connections can be quite fragile, and anything that ends or degrades the WebSocket connection will require re-connection to Pusher and reauthorization on all channels.</p>
      <p>As a client implementor, you are encouraged to gain as much insight into the behavior on client devices as you can, whether that is through logging or allowing upload of connection logs to a location of your choice.</p>
      <p>We also encourage you to create a "Reconnect" button that performs the reconnection and reauthorization process manually, while you work to ensure that it is never needed.</p>
